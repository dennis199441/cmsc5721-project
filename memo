PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is.

PR_i = (1 - d)/N + d * summation( I_ij * PR_j / n_j)

Higher PageRank --> Better quality





In stock correlation network, nodes are connecte to each other if their correlation coefficient is greater than threshold theta.

We are interested in stocks that are having higher return and lower risk (standard deviation) i.e higher return-risk ratio (return / standard deviation).

Using return-rish ratio to measure the `quality` of stock.

StockRank (SR)
SR_i = (1 - d)/N + d * summation(I_ij * W_ij * SR_j / n_j))
